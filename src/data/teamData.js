            in the illustrious film gang; FLYONTHEWALL Productions. Until this point, a musical life was but 
            a dream and so he hastily set about learning the craft of sound and story; quickly becoming 
            FOTW's in-house composer. Fast forward 7 years, Si now co-pilots the Field mother ship 
            alongside his impressive comrades. Celebrated for his ability to weave tapestries of sound, 
            Simon is applauded for his deep sensitivities, diplomacy and gentle nature; his beats though, are 
            big as f%&amp;k.`,
