      "Edun is a fashion brand based in New York, who collaborate with artisans across the African continent to produce sustainable, high quality garments. Adriaan Louw directed this mini-documentary, focussing on the brand outlook and the relationships between them and their partners in Nairobi, Kenya. Adriaan did a great job of recording a hand loom, operated by one of the films subjects, which was used as the starting point of the score’s tempo and steady, hypnotic atmosphere. Many cues were also taken from traditional Masaai music and chants.",
